# Chaos Game • Sierpiński Triangle

**From randomness to fractal order.**

This project is an HTML/JS visualization of the Sierpiński triangle
using the **Chaos Game** with a fair die.

## How it works
1. Place three vertices A, B, C.
2. Roll a fair die:
   - 1–2 → A
   - 3–4 → B
   - 5–6 → C
3. From the current point move halfway to the chosen vertex.
4. Plot the new point and repeat.

Over time, the points converge to the **Sierpiński triangle** —
a fractal with Hausdorff dimension:
